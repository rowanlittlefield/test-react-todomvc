# TodoMVC (REACT)
(official description of the framework from its website)

### Resources

### Implementation
This app is a To-Do app where a user can create, destroy, and keep track of tasks that they need to accomplish. The app was implemented using the React framework with a Redux store for holding and updating the 'todo' state. The npm webpack module was used to bundle all of the relevant JavaScript files into a single script.
