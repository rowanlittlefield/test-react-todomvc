# TodoMVC (REACT)
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

### Resources

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

### Implementation
This app is a To-Do app where a user can create, destroy, and keep track of tasks that they need to accomplish. The app was implemented using the React framework with a Redux store for holding and updating the 'todo' state. The npm webpack module was used to bundle all of the relevant JavaScript files into a single script.

The app can be built after cloning/downloading this repository by running `npm install` followed by `npm run webpack` in the terminal in this project's directory. The first command will download all of the dependencies needed to build the app, while the second command should generate the `bundle.js` and `bundle.js.map` scripts used to run the app. Make sure to have the latest version of npm installed before running these commands. Then open index.html in a browser in order to use the app.
